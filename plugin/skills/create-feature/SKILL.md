# Creating and Populating Features in DerivaML

Features link domain objects (e.g., Image, Subject) to a set of values — controlled vocabulary terms, computed values, or assets. Every feature value is associated with an execution, so you can differentiate between multiple values by execution RID, workflow, description, or timestamp. Features are inherently multivalued, enabling inter-annotator agreement, model comparison, and audit trails.

Common uses include classification labels, transformed data, statistical aggregates, quality scores, segmentation masks, and any structured annotation that needs provenance.

For background on feature types, metadata columns, multivalued features, and feature selection, see `references/concepts.md`.

## Critical Rules

1. **Vocabulary must exist first** — create the vocabulary table and add terms before creating a term-based feature.
2. **Feature values require an active execution** — this is a hard requirement for provenance tracking.
3. **Use the right tool for the job**:
   - `add_feature_value` — simple features with a single term or asset column
   - `add_feature_value_record` — features with multiple columns (e.g., term + confidence score)
4. **Use feature selection for multivalued features** — when a record has multiple values, use `fetch_table_features` with `selector="newest"` or `workflow` to resolve to one value per record.

## Workflow Summary

1. `create_vocabulary` + `add_term` — define the label set (if needed; see `manage-vocabulary` skill)
2. `create_feature` — link a target table to vocabulary terms, assets, or both
3. `create_execution` + `start_execution` — start provenance tracking
4. `add_feature_value` / `add_feature_value_record` — assign values to records in batch
5. `stop_execution` — finalize (no `upload_execution_outputs` needed — feature operations don't produce output files)

For the full step-by-step guide with code examples (both MCP tools and Python API), see `references/workflow.md`.
